Bibliographic data sourcing
===========================

BibXML service deals with two types
of :term:`bibliographic data sources <bibliographic data source>`.

Internal sources
================

Internal sources are under IETF control,
and are maintained as Git repositories
with Relaton and BibXML bibliographic data serialized into YAML/XML files
under ``data/`` within repository root.
They are periodically updated by tools outside of BibXML service.

These repositories are registered as :term:`indexable sources <indexable source>`.
(When BibXML service is instructed to reindex any indexable source,
it queues an asynchronous task
that pulls or clones the relevant repositories and runs specified indexer function
that reads the data and populates the database.)

   - :mod:`main.sources`

External sources
================

External sources donâ€™t make bibliographic data available
in bulk in Relaton format.
