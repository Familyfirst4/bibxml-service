For an overview, see https://github.com/ietf-ribose/bibxml-project.

This project uses Docker, Django and PostgreSQL.


Quick start
-----------

Ensure you have Docker Desktop with Compose V2 enabled,
navigate to cloned repository root on your machine
and run the following commands::

    docker compose build
    cd docs
    docker compose up

.. note:: If you donâ€™t use Docker Desktop,
          you may need to install Compose separately.

          If you install it as a separate binary,
          you should replace ``docker compose`` with ``docker-compose``,
          and depending on your installation
          you might need to prepend ``sudo``.

After that, point your browser to ``localhost:8001`` for further documentation.

You can browse documentation `on GitHub <docs/index.rst>`_,
but as it makes use of Sphinx-specific directives there will be rendering issues.
