==============
BibXML Service
==============

For an overview, see https://github.com/ietf-ribose/bibxml-project.

This project uses Docker, Django and PostgreSQL.


Quick start
-----------

Please refer to `“Building documentation” section <docs/howto/develop-locally.rst#building-documentation>`_.

Documentation has a section on setting up BibXML service locally.

You can browse documentation `on GitHub <docs/index.rst>`_,
but as it makes use of Sphinx-specific directives unsupported by GitHub
it is recommended to build the documentation into HTML.
This can be done using Docker without any other dependencies.
